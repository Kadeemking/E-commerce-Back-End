# ORM E-commerce Back End

## Description

I developed the backend functionality for a starter e-commerce application, focusing on integrating and managing the database using Sequelize. This project enhanced my skills in setting up database models, associations, and queries while leveraging Sequelize's features. Additionally, I tested and refined API routes using Insomnia, ensuring seamless interaction between the database and application.

On the other side, input "npm run seed" to seed your database. Then after input "npm start" to run your server. 

You can test all the routes in insomnia after the server is running.
